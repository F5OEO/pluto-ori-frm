After reading this online http://irq5.io/2016/12/22/raspberry-pi-zero-as-multiple-usb-gadgets/ 

I realized that maybe I need to add Windows specific descriptors to my device to make it enumerate completely. So I've done this on the linux side after viewing usbaudio2.inf and finding the string %SubClass_00.DeviceDesc%=usbaudio2_Device, USB\Class_01&SubClass_00&Prot_20: 

echo 1 > bDeviceClass
echo 0 > bDeviceSubClass
echo 20 > bDeviceProtocol
echo 1       > os_desc/use
echo 0xcd    > os_desc/b_vendor_code
echo MSFT100 > os_desc/qw_sign
ln -s configs/c.1 os_desc

This is an improvement since now I see the correct name of my device under "sound, video and game controllers" but there is still an exclamation mark over the device and it still shows This device cannot start. (Code 10)
